# goto-similar
A plugin for Sublime to add a useful feature to Goto Anything.

Autofills Goto Anything search field with the basename of the file you're currently viewing without the extension. This automatically limits the search to files with the same name so you can easily find related files. This helps with .cpp/.h, .js/.html/.less, etc.
